development", "slug": "starting-web-development", "timestamp": "2023-06-17T16:34:47.305Z", "content": "This is a small documentation intended to explain web development . It is based on the excellent content provided by Mozilla in their [Getting started with the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) guide.\r\n\r\n## Starting\r\n\r\nThe following list presents a recommendation of tools to perform an effective and focused development for the creation of simple websites.\r\n\r\n+ A text editor: Visual Studio Code. Free and with tons of useful extensions.\r\n+ A graphics editor: GIMP or Photoshop.\r\n+ A version control system: Git (+ Github).\r\n+ An (S)FTP software: FileZilla. It is used to manage files on servers, Git is starting to replace FTP because it also add the control version feature.\r\n+ An automation system: Gulp. To save time by automatically performing some tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc.\r\n\r\n### The looks and content\r\n\r\n+ Content: what are you going to write about or what do you want to show?\r\n+ Design: you can start with a simple sketch that you can then complete as design and content ideas arise.\r\n+ Color: you should have a theme color.\r\n+ Font: depending on the content you have to give a style or another to the page, not only to capture the reader's attention. Furthermore, the highly useful information you are providing should presented with an adequate readability. If you are going to use different styles consider one for titles and headings, another one for main content, and if necessary, another one for subtitles and quotes. Consider 150% line spacing for the font size used (if it is 16px -> 24 px), and 16 px for font size of the main body text. Use multiples of 16 px for other elements. Once the fonts have been chosen, there is the possibility to load them from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) (issues with data privacy regulation in Europe), or host the fonts directly. Google fonts provides recommendations about the combination of fonts. Consider:\r\n\r\n    + Open Sans (sans serif): versatile.\r\n    + Lato (sans serif): headlines and subtitles.\r\n    + Lora (serif): (contemporary) lots of content expected.\r\n    + Georgia (serif): (classic) lots of content expected.\r\n    + Myriad Pro (sans serif): classic and contemporary.\r\n\r\n### File structure\r\n\r\nA website is a set of files that are called sequentially or synchronously. Before deploy a website on the server, we usually work locally to test functionalities and design. You should create a structure similar to the one that will be hosted on the server. Inside a folder like `web-projects` you enter `test-site`. Consider always using hyphen for any file or folder name and in lowercase, so that a consistent notation is followed. This is also common practice for Google.\r\n\r\nThe structure:\r\n\r\n+ `index.html`: contains the homepage content.\r\n+ images folder.\r\n+ styles folder: CSS code for styling content.\r\n+ scripts folder: JavaScript code to add interactive functionality.\r\n\r\nFor files to call each other, file paths must be provided. In the case of Windows, although it uses backslashes, you must always use forward slashes because the code will be read by the browser.\r\n\r\n### Live website\r\n\r\nOnce the site is ready, usually tested locally, it is time to put it online. Depending on the objective it can be interesting to rent a domain name (unique internet address) from a domain registrar. Also hiring a web hosting makes the process much easier. It is a service in which you can host your files, a web server, which will publish the content online. This is where teh FTP software comes in.\r\n\r\nThere are several web apps, which are usually free and provide basic features, that help in the learning process or can even be used to show new code or ask for debugging help. They render the site in an unique web addres but usually they don't have space for assets like images. Consider [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).\r\n\r\nOne of the quickest free options for publishing your site is via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).\r\n\r\n## Web server\r\n\r\nA web server as hardware is a computer with internet connection that contains the web server software, and the files needed to display the site. These files usually include HTML, CSS and JavaScript and all the assets you need. Finding, and paying in case of need, a good hosting provider is key to having a functional website. The advantages are that they are regularly maintained, will always be connected to the internet, and will usually have a dedicated IP address.\r\n\r\nThe web server software controls how users access the hosted files. The devices that are connected to the Internet and use a browser are the clients. They make requests to servers. They then respond to the clients by providing a copy of the requested content that is displayed in the browser.\r\n\r\nIn a more extended form it can be summarized as follows.\r\n\r\n1. When you type in a web address, the browser goes to a DNS server and looks up the associated IP address, which is a unique location on the web. This means that if you type the IP address directly you will arrive at the same page.\r\n2. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server (providing and URL), asking for a copy of the site. HTTP is an application protocol that defines the language to be used during communication between the two parties. It specifies how to transfer hypertext (linked web documents). All commands are plain-text. This communication and any data sent is done over an internet connection using TCP/IP, which are protocols that define how the communication will be done. The server answers always every request, at least with an error (404).\r\n3. When the server approves the request it responds with a \"200 OK\" and starts sending the website data packets. These are many small chunks, which allow to speed up the sending, especially when several clients ask for the same thing, and to fix chunks that can easily get corrupted along the way.\r\n4. The browser puts them together, and the code files and assets are obtained. The browser will first parse HTML files (such as `index.html`), which will lead it to recognize `<link>` and `<script>` elements. These will contain CSS and JavaScript files which will also be downloaded and parsed. An HTML DOM tree, a CSS CSSOM, and the JavaScript code will then be compiled and executed in memory. This DOM identifies each of the HTML elements and converts them into an object representation, with which languages like JavaScript can now interact and make the programmed changes. This will display the web.\r\n\r\nThe server can host static websites, and therefore sends as-is files to the browser, after the `GET` request. When you have dynamic websites, there is usually an application server, which receives requested data in the form of URL encoding, GET/POST data or cookies, that contains the server-side programming that modifies HTML templates and other files, adding content from a database. Static resources (assets) are retrieved in the same way as with static sites. \r\n\r\nServer-side code involves which data is sent after a correct request. This includes validation of requests, managing databases and templates, authentication, etc. For this, developers use web frameworks, a collection of functions, objects and other code designed to speed up coding, and simplify common problems and tasks. Languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, and JavaScript (NodeJS). You have extensive control over the response and the content to be sent. By using databases there is an efficient storage as well as being able to share and update it constantly. It is also possible to send data, for example JSON or XML, which the client-side will use, reducing the work done by the server. This is the idea behind AJAX, the browser can dynamically update its own content. Single-page apps are also becoming popular, using a single HTML file that is dynamically updated. User information can be stored to speed up your visit or make it more tailored. Access can be restricted according to user permissions, as in a blog or a contracted service. Sessions can be used to store user information and respond in different ways, such as knowing if the user has previously registered on the web.\r\n\r\nThe client-side is generally written using HTML, CSS, and JS and it is run inside the browser. It is concerned with esthetics, navigation, forms, interface, etc.\r\n\r\n### HTTP\r\n\r\nAny HTTP request includes:\r\n\r\n+ URL with with server and the target file/app\r\n+ Main methods for the requested action:\r\n  + `GET`: get a specific file. The server of a static site only needs this action, there is nothing to modify\r\n  + `POST`: create a new content\r\n  + `HEAD`: get metadata information of a file, like knowing if the when the file has been updated and get it in that case\r\n  + `PUT`: update existing file, or create it if it does not exist\r\n  + `DELETE`\r\n\r\nInformation can be encoded within the request:\r\n\r\n+ Parameters: when using `GET` we start declaring the parameters after `?`, add `name=value` pairs, separated by `&`: `http://example.com?author=Jor&job=hunter`. This is an insecure action, so that these kind of requests cannot update data.\r\n+ To add/update new data, the data is encoded within the `POST` body.\r\n+ Cookies contain keys for login actions and permissions.\r\n\r\nThe HTTP response status code is usually one of the following:\r\n\r\n+ `200 OK`: success, in case of a `GET` the response body contains the data \r\n+ `404 Not Found`: no file found\r\n+ `403 Forbidden`: no user authorization or permission\r\n\r\n### `GET` example\r\n\r\nTo capture and monitor HTTP responses and requests applications like Fiddler can be used. \r\n\r\nClicking on a link or using a searching engine, for example. Each line transmits information about the request. This first part is the header's request, in the same manner as in a HTML document:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /en-US/search?q=client+server+overview&topic=apps&topic=html&topic=css&topic=js&topic=api&topic=webdev HTTP/1.1 ACTION REQUEST + TARGET URL + PARAMETERS + PROTOCOL VERSION\r\nHost: developer.mozilla.org     TARGET WEBSITE\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nPragma: no-cache\r\nCache-Control: no-cache\r\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36      MY BROWSER\r\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\r\nReferer: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/       ORIGIN OF THE REQUEST\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch, br        ACCEPTED INFORMATION, CHARACTERS, LANGUAGES\r\nAccept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,UTF-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7\r\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,es;q=0.6\r\nCookie: sessionid=6ynxs23n521lu21b1t136rhbv7ezngie; csrftoken=zIPUJsAZv6pcgCBJSCj1zU6pQZbfMUAT; dwf_section_edit=False; dwf_sg_task_completion=False; _gat=1; _ga=GA1.2.1688886003.1471911953; ffo=true\r\nCOOKIES (IN THIS CASE FOR MANAGING SESSIONS)\r\n\r\nNO BODY IN THIS CASE\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe server's response:\r\n\r\n```http\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK     STATUS\r\nServer: Apache      SERVER\r\nX-Backend-Server: developer1.webapp.scl3.mozilla.com\r\nVary: Accept, Cookie, Accept-Encoding\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8      RESPONSE FORMATED AND CHARACTERS\r\nDate: Wed, 07 Sep 2016 00:11:31 GMT     GENERATION OF RESPONSE\r\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5, max=999\r\nConnection: Keep-Alive\r\nX-Frame-Options: DENY       OPTIONS TELLING THE BROWSER HOW TO HANDLE THE PAGE (DO NOT ALLOW TO BE EMBEDDED IN <iframe>)\r\nAllow: GET\r\nX-Cache-Info: caching\r\nContent-Length: 41823       CONTENT SIZE\r\n\r\nBODY (WITH HTML FILE)\r\n\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en-US\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"redesign no-js\"  data-ffo-opensanslight=false data-ffo-opensans=false >\r\n<head prefix=\"og: http://ogp.me/ns#\">\r\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n  <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=Edge\">\r\n  <script>(function(d) { d.className = d.className.replace(/\\bno-js/, ''); })(document.documentElement);</script>\r\n  ΓÇª\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `POST` example\r\n\r\nRequest (new profile submission):\r\n\r\n```http\r\nHTTP/1.1 POST /en-US/profiles/hamishwillee/edit     \r\nHost: developer.mozilla.org\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nContent-Length: 432\r\nPragma: no-cache\r\nCache-Control: no-cache\r\nOrigin: https://developer.mozilla.org\r\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36\r\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\r\nReferer: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/profiles/hamishwillee/edit\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\r\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,es;q=0.6\r\nCookie: sessionid=6ynxs23n521lu21b1t136rhbv7ezngie; _gat=1; csrftoken=zIPUJsAZv6pcgCBJSCj1zU6pQZbfMUAT; dwf_section_edit=False; dwf_sg_task_completion=False; _ga=GA1.2.1688886003.1471911953; ffo=true\r\n\r\nINFORMATION OF THE FORM ENCONDED IN THE BODY\r\n\r\ncsrfmiddlewaretoken=zIPUJsAZv6pcgCBJSCj1zU6pQZbfMUAT&user-username=hamishwillee&user-fullname=Hamish+Willee&user-title=&user-organization=&user-location=Australia&user-locale=en-US&user-timezone=Australia%2FMelbourne&user-irc_nickname=&user-interests=&user-expertise=&user-twitter_url=&user-stackoverflow_url=&user-linkedin_url=&user-mozillians_url=&user-facebook_url=\r\n```\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n\r\n```http\r\nHTTP/1.1 302 FOUND      POST SUCCEEDED\r\nServer: Apache\r\nX-Backend-Server: developer3.webapp.scl3.mozilla.com\r\nVary: Cookie\r\nVary: Accept-Encoding\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nDate: Wed, 07 Sep 2016 00:38:13 GMT\r\nLocation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/profiles/hamishwillee     SECOND HTTP TO LOAD THIS PAGE AFTER 302 CODE\r\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5, max=1000\r\nConnection: Keep-Alive\r\nX-Frame-Options: DENY\r\nX-Cache-Info: not cacheable; request wasn't a GET or HEAD\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Web frameworks\r\n\r\nServer-side web frameworks facilitate the tasks of writing, maintaining and scale web apps. They are loaded with libraries, functions and tools to simplify common tasks. They include:\r\n\r\n+ Work with HTTP: use a simplified syntax to work with the responses and requests\r\n+ Mapping URL and resources/files: the idea is to route URL patterns to specific functions\r\n+ Access data in request: easily substract the URL parameters, cookies, types, etc.\r\n+ Abstract database access: frameworks often come with an abstraction layer (Object-Relational Mapper, ORM) of the database, symplifying the read, write, and delete operations. This makes it possible to changes the database without needing to change the code to connect with it. Validation of data to make safer operations like check data type, format, and maliciousness\r\n+ Templates: the structure of the output file is declared, and then placeholders will be substituted with required data\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n\r\nPreventing attacks on our website such as unauthorized access, inappropriate use, database modification, requires designing defense mechanisms and activating options such as HTTPS. Most web frameworks come with many defense options activated by default.\r\n\r\nTo make sure you have taken into account all common problems, there are vulnerability scanners that analyze your site to describe possible problems.\r\n\r\nMost of the attacks come from trusting or not being very strict with the information received by the browser. The following threats are the most common:\r\n\r\n+ XSS (Cross-side scripting): to inject client-side scripts through the website to other user's browser. Since the injected code comes from the site the browser trusts it, which allows the attacker to send login information for example, such as cookie data. There are two types of vulnerabilities. Reflected XSS occurs when the user, for example, sends a request to the server that is returned immediately and unmodified, which will execute any code or other functions that have been sent. This could come from using a link that someone has sent us, so that our information is sent to the attacker. Persistent XSS occurs when the malicious code is hosted on the site, and other users execute it just by visiting the section containing it. This can be contained in the comments of a post and when users see the comment in question the code will be executed, stealing their login information. \r\n\r\n  The most common way to exploit this vulnerability is through `GET` and `POST`, although it can also be in files uploaded by users, or cookies. The best defense against this is input sanitization, which prevents any markup containing code such as `<script>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<link` from being executed.\r\n\r\n+ SQL injection: This is an attack in which the database is altered, getting private information or deleting it, or modifying user permissions to get administrative rights for example, among many other possibilities. This is achieved when the attacker passes an input that can interact with the database, something typical of a form. To avoid this, it is necessary to escape characters that have meaning within SQL, such as ', which indicates the beginning of a new statement. This is done by placing `\\'`.\r\n\r\n+ CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): For example, if the attacker knows a site where cookies or a `POST` request is used to send money, he can create something like a form and send it to this site. When a user with his credentials from the original site clicks this malicious link, the details will be confirmed and money or other information will be sent to the attacker. To avoid this the server sends each user a secret (key) associated to the form that will be sent with his `POST` request, so it will not accept it if it is not accompanied by this.\r\n\r\n+ Clickjacking: it is to place invisible buttons on top of the original ones, or that have another functionality, which is commonly done by embedding your content inside an `<iframe>` in another site. This can be avoided by configuring it in the header.\r\n\r\n+ DoS (Deniel of Service): attempts are made to collapse the server with many requests or very large files so that legitimate users cannot make normal use of the server. Normally your defense is done before reaching the web application, these bad requests are detected.\r\n\r\n+ In other attacks they try to access part of the web server file system that they shouldn't have access, execute commands on the host system. The key to all of them is to sanitize the input.", "author": 1, "featured": null, "categories": [2]}}, {"model": "blogapp.post", "pk": 5, "fields": {"title": "First look to Django (Python)", "slug": "django-primer", "timestamp": "2023-06-19T14:54:05.628Z", "content": "Django is a high-level Python web framework that comes with many features to develop a robust and secure website. This information is based on the excellent content provided by Mozilla in their [Django Introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Introduction) guide.\r\n\r\nDjango is really complete, many functions are already considered and work out of the box, and versatile as it provides several choices for any functionality. It has secure features to defend from all the mentioned attacks. Scalable by having an independent architecture that allows changing parts as needed. Portable as it is based on Python, it can be executed in almost any system.\r\n\r\nYou could say that Django is opinionated because it offers its own right way to solve problems within a scope, which is supposed to be well documented and validated.\r\n\r\nTo manage a dynamic site Django is organized using the Model View Template (MVT) architecture. It can be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n+ URLs: When an HTTP request is received, a URL mapper is used to redirect this URL request to the appropriate view. The mapper can extract strings or digits from the URL and send them directly to the view functions as input data.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# the mapper defines pairs of routes (URL patterns) with view functions\r\nurlpatterns = [\r\n  path('admin/', admin.site.urls),\r\n  path('book/<int:id>/', views.book_detail, name='book_detail'),\r\n  path('catalog/', include('catalog.urls')),\r\n  re_path(r'^([0-9]+)/$', views.best), # this function can use regular expressions\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ Views: they are request handler functions, which receive the request and provide a response. They access the requested data using models, and call templates to present it.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\r\n\r\ndef index(request):\r\n  # Get an HttpRequest - the request parameter\r\n  # perform operations using information from the request.\r\n  # Return HttpResponse\r\n  return HttpResponse('Hello from Django!')\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ Models: they are python objects that interact with the database and define the data structure. The types and sizes and other options, like a list of possibilities can be defined. The definition of the model is independent of the underlying data, which makes it a very powerful feature.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.db import models\r\n\r\nclass Team(models.Model):\r\n  team_name = models.CharField(max_length=40)\r\n\r\n  TEAM_LEVELS = (\r\n      ('U09', 'Under 09s'),\r\n      ('U10', 'Under 10s'),\r\n      ('U11', 'Under 11s'),\r\n      # ΓÇª\r\n      # list other team levels\r\n  )\r\n  team_level = models.CharField(max_length=3, choices=TEAM_LEVELS, default='U11')\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ Templates: it is a text file that defines the layout with placeholders to present the data requested in the request. It can be an HTML or other format. Django supports apart from his native template system, Jinja2.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\r\nfrom .models import Team\r\n\r\ndef index(request):\r\n  # use query to get this data\r\n  list_teams = Team.objects.filter(team_level__exact=\"U09\") \r\n  context = {'youngest_teams': list_teams}\r\n  # render the html\r\n  return render(request, '/best/index.html', context) \r\n```\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n<head>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n<title>Home page</title>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n{% if youngest_teams %}\r\n  <ul>\r\n    {% for team in youngest_teams %}\r\n      <li>{{ team.team_name }}</li>\r\n    {% endfor %}\r\n  </ul>\r\n{% else %}\r\n  <p>No teams are available.</p>\r\n{% endif %}\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ Others.\r\n    + Forms: Django simplifies form creation, validation, and processing\r\n    + Users: authentication and permissions with security features\r\n    + Caching: save part of the site to avoid having to render the whole site every time\r\n    + Administration site: django provides an administration page to create content, consult data, and other tasks\r\n    + Serialization: serialize the data (as XML or JSON) for client-side code to render your site", "author": 1, "featured": null, "categories": [2]}}, {"model": "blogapp.post", "pk": 6, "fields": {"title": "Virtual environment with conda", "slug": "venv-conda", "timestamp": "2023-06-22T13:02:14.525Z", "content": "It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment when our project is going to depend on several packages, so that we make sure that it will always work if the same versions are used as we do.\r\n\r\nMost tutorials describe how to configure a Python environment under Unix-systems. This is because these OS, such linux or Mac, have package management systems like `pip` that are optimized for them. On Windows these management systems also exist, but due to dependencies that accompany the main packages and were precompiled under other OS they may fail to get installed correctly. `conda` is a package, dependency, and environment management system that comes with the Anaconda distribution. It is the first choice for data science and machine learning due to its easy install and configuration process of the several libraries/packages required, with many of them already preinstalled. It comes with an IDE that resembles other interesting languages like Matlab or R.\r\n\r\nGo to their [web page](https://www.anaconda.com/) and choose the Anaconda version according to the Python version that goes with it. Notice that the Python version could be changed by using environments as described later. It is recommended not to add Anaconda to the PATH environment variable as it may mess with other Python installations and environments, so I would not recommend to accept this option unless only working with base installation. Once installed it is possible to use the Anaconda Navigator to manage every action or the Anaconda Powershell Prompt. \r\n\r\nThe first step is to create virtual environments for each project. The idea behind this is compatibility. When running applications coded long ago or projects from other developers being consistent with the versions used is the key to reproduce the expected results. At the same time it may become a sandbox for safe testing environment. `conda` includes its own manager that is optimized for numerical packages that often come with non-python dependencies, and it is possible to change the Python version (it seems this is not straightforward with `virtualenv`). Let's see some useful commands:\r\n\r\n+ `conda env list`: available conda environments\r\n+ `conda create --name <nameenv> python=3.X`: create another environment with an specific python version (necessary to have the minimun functionalities)\r\n+ `conda activate <nameenv>` and `conda deactivate` will activate and deactivate the env. Notice between the parentheses the name of the active env\r\n+ `conda remove --name <nameenv> --all`: remove the env\r\n+ `conda list`: list of installed packages\r\n+ `conda search <packagename>`: looks for the specified name package in the repositories (channels for conda) and displays the version and under which python version they were built\r\n+ `conda install <packagename>`: the newest version will be installed with all the necessary dependencies. The version can be specified as showed before, and even the python version can be changed with this command\r\n+ `conda install <packagename> --dry-run`: this command will check which packages will be changed after installation. If we install a specific version of package, it may downgrade our current python version, something that we don't want depending on the case\r\n+ `conda update <packagename>`: update the package or use `--all` for updating everything\r\n+ `remove <packagename>`: remove\r\n+ conda list --export > requirements.txt: create dependencies document (as `pip freeze -r requirements.txt`)\r\n+ `conda create --name <envname> --file requirements.txt`: duplicate the previous saved environment\r\n\r\nSometimes the packages are not found in the default channels that are configured. Although it is possible to add multiple channels, I find more suitable to just go to the Anaconda [main page](https://anaconda.org/) and look for the command to install a specific package. Similarly, for pure python packages `pip` is the option to go. We should do `conda install pip` and then within the installed env `pip install <packagename>`.", "author": 1, "featured": null, "categories": [4]}}, {"model": "blogapp.post", "pk": 7, "fields": {"title": "Primer on GIT", "slug": "primergit", "timestamp": "2023-06-22T14:54:51.850Z", "content": "Git is a distributed version control system (open source). Control system means that we can store content, like code. Version means we can keep track of the evolution of files, which you can save at any time (as a backup), and then return to that point if required. Saving this state is called commit. Subsequently, you can continue editing and create other commits. A message should be added to each one with a detailed explanation of changes made, in order to take advantage of another feature, which is the comparison between different versions. In this way, there is a description so that several developers can follow the evolution of the project. Distributed refers to the idea that each developer has a local copy of the repository (the container of all commits), and he/she will connect to propose changes, therefore if we update our copy, we will have the latest version, but at the same time we can work independently.\r\n\r\n### Installing Git (in VS Code)\r\n\r\nFirst we install Git in our system using the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Use the default or recommended options when prompted, in my case I only changed the default bash to the system's bash. Reboot all open bash. Check the installation is correct: `git --version`.\r\n\r\nAt this moment we should have created a GitHub account that we will connect to our new local Git system, and check that the data is correct.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit config --global user.name \"<YourUserNameOnGithub>\"\r\ngit config --global user.email \"<YourEmail>\"\r\ngit config --global --list\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in VS Code if we visit the Source Control tab (remember to reload) we should see a message saying that our current folder is not yet a local repository. If it is we will see all the changes proposed.\r\n\r\n### Basic usage\r\n\r\n1. Let's start by creating a local repository in the folder we choose and add it to the project using `git init`.\r\n\r\n2. Imagine we have already several files in the folder.\r\n\r\n3. Then we stage the files, meaning they are placed in the staging area (possible commits), where the system keeps track of the files to be commited. With `git add .` all files inside the folder will be added to the staging area. Note that by declaring the file name only those files will be staged `git add hello.py`\r\n\r\n4. With `git status` we can check which files were modified and which files are already in the staging area. When we add a new file to this folder and do a status it will tell us that there is a file but it is not under review (untracked).\r\n\r\n5. Use `git commit -m \"Description of the commit\"` to add files to the local repository.\r\n\r\n### Staging area and .gitignore\r\n\r\nThe mentioned staging area is an index, the way to track the changes you want to make in the next commit. If there is a modified file and we add it, it go from _untracked_ to _to be commited_. At the time you enter this area by doing an `git add file` it will have its exact contents, but if we make any changes now, we will see that a _status_ tells us that it is both _staged_ and _unstaged_. So there can be three versions of a file: (i) the one you are editing, (ii) the one that was saved in the _staging_ and (iii) the last one that was checked into the repository. A commit will cause these versions to be synchronized.\r\n\r\n### .gitignore\r\n\r\nIf it comes the case that we don't want some files to be stored/tracked there is a way. As a basic rule only source files (hello.py) and never generated files (hello.pyc) should be uploaded to the repository. The latter are constantly altered, since they are interpreted by the computer, so they could conflict if they are included, and they also take up more space than the source files. This also includes files created by our editor. This has to do with the way Git works, since it does not store complete copies of each version, but saves the changes between them, thus saving space. For binary files (such as images or audios) they will normally be stored complete. \r\n\r\nWe need to create a _.gitignore_ file in the root folder (where _init_ was called) and fill it with something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Django #\r\n*.log\r\n*.pot\r\n*.pyc\r\n__pycache__\r\ndb.sqlite3\r\nmedia\r\n\r\n# Backup files # \r\n*.bak \r\n\r\n# If you are using PyCharm # \r\n# User-specific stuff\r\n.idea/**/workspace.xml\r\n.idea/**/tasks.xml\r\n.idea/**/usage.statistics.xml\r\n.idea/**/dictionaries\r\n.idea/**/shelf\r\n\r\n# AWS User-specific\r\n.idea/**/aws.xml\r\n\r\n# Generated files\r\n.idea/**/contentModel.xml\r\n\r\n# Sensitive or high-churn files\r\n.idea/**/dataSources/\r\n.idea/**/dataSources.ids\r\n.idea/**/dataSources.local.xml\r\n.idea/**/sqlDataSources.xml\r\n.idea/**/dynamic.xml\r\n.idea/**/uiDesigner.xml\r\n.idea/**/dbnavigator.xml\r\n\r\n# Gradle\r\n.idea/**/gradle.xml\r\n.idea/**/libraries\r\n\r\n# File-based project format\r\n*.iws\r\n\r\n# IntelliJ\r\nout/\r\n\r\n# JIRA plugin\r\natlassian-ide-plugin.xml\r\n\r\n# Python # \r\n*.py[cod] \r\n*$py.class \r\n\r\n# Distribution / packaging \r\n.Python build/ \r\ndevelop-eggs/ \r\ndist/ \r\ndownloads/ \r\neggs/ \r\n.eggs/ \r\nlib/ \r\nlib64/ \r\nparts/ \r\nsdist/ \r\nvar/ \r\nwheels/ \r\n*.egg-info/ \r\n.installed.cfg \r\n*.egg \r\n*.manifest \r\n*.spec \r\n\r\n# Installer logs \r\npip-log.txt \r\npip-delete-this-directory.txt \r\n\r\n# Unit test / coverage reports \r\nhtmlcov/ \r\n.tox/ \r\n.coverage \r\n.coverage.* \r\n.cache \r\n.pytest_cache/ \r\nnosetests.xml \r\ncoverage.xml \r\n*.cover \r\n.hypothesis/ \r\n\r\n# Jupyter Notebook \r\n.ipynb_checkpoints \r\n\r\n# pyenv \r\n.python-version \r\n\r\n# celery \r\ncelerybeat-schedule.* \r\n\r\n# SageMath parsed files \r\n*.sage.py \r\n\r\n# Environments \r\n.env \r\n.venv \r\nenv/ \r\nvenv/ \r\nENV/ \r\nenv.bak/ \r\nvenv.bak/ \r\n\r\n# mkdocs documentation \r\n/site \r\n\r\n# mypy \r\n.mypy_cache/ \r\n\r\n# Sublime Text # \r\n*.tmlanguage.cache \r\n*.tmPreferences.cache \r\n*.stTheme.cache \r\n*.sublime-workspace \r\n*.sublime-project \r\n\r\n# sftp configuration file \r\nsftp-config.json \r\n\r\n# Package control specific files Package \r\nControl.last-run \r\nControl.ca-list \r\nControl.ca-bundle \r\nControl.system-ca-bundle \r\nGitHub.sublime-settings \r\n\r\n# Visual Studio Code # \r\n.vscode/* \r\n!.vscode/settings.json \r\n!.vscode/tasks.json \r\n!.vscode/launch.json \r\n!.vscode/extensions.json \r\n.history\r\n```\r\n\r\n### SHA and log\r\n\r\nEvery time something is stored in the repository a hash function creates a 20 byte SHA ID for the items. It is used to have an index of each item, as well as for each directory. Changes to a file in a directory also produce changes to the directory. Each commit shows the SHA of the top-level directory affected. Often instead of the full 20 bytes you can take those that allow to distinguish it, 7 is usually enough.\r\n\r\nWith the `git log` command we can list in chronological order the commits made so far. All of them will start with _commit SHA_. \r\n\r\n### Versions and branches\r\n\r\nWith the log information if we want to check out a previous version of the code we will use `git checkout <SHA>`. Several terms appear in this context; HEAD refers to the commit you are checking out (referencing an SHA); branch marks a tag over an SHA, identifying its commit. To return to the last commit we can do the same with a checkout indicating the SHA of this one, or the name of its branch, which is always called _master_ to begin with.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of the branches is to separate the different parts of a development, instead of uploading it to the master we can work in another branch to not interfere with the work of others. We can create a new branch in local with `git branch test`. To change to this branch, since we are still in the master, we write `git checkout test`. To list all the branches in local we use `git branch`. To make a quickly comparison we write `git show-branch test master`.\r\n\r\nOnce you want to send those changes there are three ways to commit from one branch to another:\r\n\r\n+ Merge. The last two SHA of each branch are combined. If in the destination branch the HEAD points to the last SHA a quick merge will be done, positioning the new commits there. To do this, first we come back to the master branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit checkout master\r\ngit merge test\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have to be careful with conflicts, because if the same section was edited in both branches, git would not know what to do. You could do the reverse path. If someone is working on a different branch and the master is updated affecting your current work, you can commit it to your branch. Being non-destructive it has the problem that it can accumulate a lot of commits and make it difficult to track.\r\n\r\n+ Rebase. Moving a series of commits to a new base, the whole flow is placed in front, integrating different branches. You can achieve a linear history and avoid adding local commits. Be careful because it can overwrite other branches and break the workflow.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit checkout feature\r\ngit rebase master\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ Cherry-Picking. When you want to add the change of a single commit, not a whole branch. To do this you go to the branch you want to add and tell it what the SHA of the commit is:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit cherry-pick SHA\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Remote repositories\r\n\r\nThe commands described above only work in local repositories, if you want to communicate with a server or over the network there are several possibilities.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we go to our GitHub account and create a new project/repository, saving the URL.\r\n\r\nIn order to point our local repository to the remote one we write: \r\n\r\n```\r\ngit remote add origin <repository url>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can push all of the new files to the remote repository. The files go from master to master branches. This action sends information about the branch you propose to add and asks the remote if they would like to update their version with yours.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit push -u origin master\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe option _-u_ is used to map a branch in your local to a branch on remote so that you can just do git push or git pull and it will know which branch to push/pull from.\r\n\r\nIn our github page one of the most interesting options is to make a fork to a repository, that is, we can copy it to our account and experiment with it without affecting the original project. This can be used to propose changes or serve as a starting point for another project. Locally, this is done using:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone <repository url>\r\ngit remote add upstream <repository url>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second command is used to keep the repository updated (thus it is optional).\r\n\r\nWhen a repository is cloned it creates a similar one locally. What it doesn't do is to show locally the branches except master, however it keeps track of the ones that were on the server. To do this it establishes an index that will have a structure like _remotes/origin/<branch_name>_. When a branch is created and its name matches one of the remote one, it will be marked as a tracking branch, it will be useful for _pull_. So what `git fetch` does is to update the branches in _remotes/origin_ and does not touch the local ones.\r\n\r\nThe command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit pull origin master\r\n```\r\n\r\npulls the most update version of the remote repository. It is the combination of _fetch+merge_.\r\n\r\n### Workflow\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that you are working on a local repository and you have a remote one to push to, plus it will have already been cloned:\r\n\r\n1. `git status` the current area is clean.\r\n2. `git pull` get the latest version from the remote, saves merging problems.\r\n3. Edit files.\r\n4. `git status` find changes and watch untracked.\r\n5. `git add [files]` add modified files to staging.\r\n6. `git commit -m \"message\"` commit.\r\n7. `git push origin [branch-name]` upload the changes to the remote.", "author": 1, "featured": null, "categories": [5]}}, {"model": "blogapp.postpersonal", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "What is the Tyndall effect?", "slug": "tyndall-PP", "timestamp": "2023-06-20T16:45:40.693Z", "content": "It's about the scattering of light as the light beam interacts with particles.
